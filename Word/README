Harvey/Word version 1.02
=======================

INSTALLATION NOTES:  

Version 1.02 comes with 3 modules: Word.pm, Verb.pm and Harvey.pm.
Word makes word objects with informtion about the word.  Verb makes
verb objects from sentences, which give information about the parsed
verb structure in the sentence.  Harvey provides a simple dialog 
routine to test and work with the parsings.  Install Word, then Verb 
and then Harvey.

With version 1.02, the Verb.pm module has been created which
receives sentences in the form of arrays of Word objects and
parses the verb.  A Harvey module has been sent along to test
the functionality of the verb parser. 

The Word.pm module is the first module of the Harvey series
which will be a suite of modules for parsing English 
sentences and generating sentences.

The Word.pm module takes a word as an argument and makes a 
word object which can be queried for characteristics about 
the word, see the documentation in the module itself for 
details.  

Usage:  
  use Harvey::Word;

  my $W = Word->new("table");

  print "It's a noun!\n" if ($W->noun());

The Word.pm module requires the word.db TIE file to be
present in the working directory.  The word.db file can be
exported to an ASCII file named word.txt using the 'export_word'
function in the module.  An 'import_word' function exists for 
the opposite operation.

NOTE: The word.pm module depends on the word.db database.  Once
the word.pm module is installed, move the word.db database to
your development directory.  If you would like to set up a special
data directory, modify the following line of the 'tie_hash'
routine as follows:

  tie %t_word,'MLDBM',"(YOUR PATH)word.db", O_CREAT|O_RDWR,0666;

My heartfelt thanks to Adam Kilgarriff for his work on the BNC 
(British National Corpus) which forms the basis for the word.db.
I have added and massaged it a bit, but I would never have gotten
this far without it.  The BNC can be visited at
