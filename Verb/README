Harvey/Verb version 1.02
========================
INSTALLATION

This module required that the Harvey::Word module already be
successfully installed, along with any supporting modules
that Word needs.  To get a feel for how this module is used,
install the Harvey::Harvey module after this module.  Harvey.pm
provides a simple dialog routine that allows sentences to be
entered, parsed and queried using the Verb.pm module.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

  Harvey::Word

The Word.pm module must be installed before Verb.pm.  See
the README in the Word install directory for additional
packages needed for word.
